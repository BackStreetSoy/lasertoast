// on click of the next button there are a few different moves to make. One way to do this would be to simply replace the src of the 'comic content' class. 
// OR...
// on DOCUMENT READY....
// load up the appropriate href of the next comic. If I'm going to do that though, I'm going to need hmm.. just reload the page?? 

var comics = 

$(document).ready(function(){
    console.log($(".comic_link"));

});
