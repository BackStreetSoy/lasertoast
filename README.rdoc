This is the repo for the lasertoast webcomic. So far I've only uploaded one comic, but this has been a really cool experience. This is a very lightweight rails app as the only real focus will be comic images for people to read and (if this doesn't suck) share. 

To implement comments I installed the comment system 'disqus'. It's the same comment system used by magazines like The Atlantic, Rolling Stone, and a web comic I like... Poorly Drawn Lines.
